- 👋 Hi, I’m @Priim3
- 👀 I’m interested in anything Science related. I'm a little biased in my interest, because i focus more on Computer Science, narrowing down to programming and networking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science via Harvard's CS50 course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Computer Science related projects involving newbies and amateurs, as i seek to use it as an opportunity to pedal the medal in my journey of becoming a computer networker and a programmer
